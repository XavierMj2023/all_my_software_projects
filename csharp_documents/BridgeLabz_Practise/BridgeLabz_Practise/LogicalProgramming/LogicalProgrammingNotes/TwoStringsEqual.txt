Write a method to check if two strings are equal or not.

If the second string’s size is more than the first it returns -1. 

Else 

it compares character by character.

If
equals it returns 0. 

Else it 

returns the position wrt the first character where the difference is found.

The line int minLen = Math.Min(len1, len2); 
-------------------------------------------------
It is used to calculate the minimum length between the two input strings, str1 and str2. 

It's necessary because when comparing the strings character by character, you want to make sure you 
don't go beyond the length of the shorter string to prevent index out-of-range errors.

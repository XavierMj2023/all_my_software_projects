Non-generic Collections							Usage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ArrayList										ArrayList stores objects of any type like an array. 
												However, there is no need to specify the size of the ArrayList like 
												with an array as it grows automatically.

SortedList										SortedList stores key and value pairs. 
												It automatically arranges elements in ascending order of key by 
												default. 
												C# includes both, generic and non-generic SortedList collection.

Stack											Stack stores the values in LIFO style (Last In First Out). 
												It provides a Push() method to add a value and Pop() & Peek() methods 
												to retrieve values. 
												C# includes both, generic and non-generic Stack.

Queue											Queue stores the values in FIFO style (First In First Out). 
												It keeps the order in which the values were added. 
												It provides an Enqueue() method to add values and a Dequeue() method 
												to retrieve values from the collection. 
												C# includes generic and non-generic Queue.

Hashtable										Hashtable stores key and value pairs. 
												It retrieves the values by comparing the hash value of the keys.

BitArray										BitArray manages a compact array of bit values, which are represented 
												as Booleans, where 
												true indicates that the bit is on (1) 
												false indicates the bit is off (0).

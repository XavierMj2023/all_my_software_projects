Filtering operators in LINQ filter the sequence (collection) based on some given criteria.

The following table lists all the filtering operators available in LINQ.

Filtering Operators					Description
------------------------------------------------
Where								Returns values from the collection based on a predicate 
									function.

OfType								Returns values from the collection based on a specified type. 
									However, it will depend on their ability to cast to a 
									specified type.

* Where Operator
  ---------------

* The Where operator (Linq extension method) filters the collection based on a given criteria 
  expression and returns a new collection. 

* The criteria can be specified as lambda expression or Func delegate type.

* The Where extension method has following two overloads. Both overload methods accepts a 
  Func delegate type parameter. 

* One overload required Func<TSource,bool> input parameter.

* Second overload method required Func<TSource, int, bool> input parameter where int is for 
  index.

* Unlike the query syntax, you need to pass whole lambda expression as a predicate function 
  instead of just body expression in LINQ method syntax.

* As mentioned above, the Where extension method also have second overload that includes index 
  of current element in the collection. You can use that index in your logic if you need.

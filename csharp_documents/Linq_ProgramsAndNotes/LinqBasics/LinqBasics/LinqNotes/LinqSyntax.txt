LINQ Syntax vs. Method Syntax
------------------------------
LINQ provides two primary ways to write queries. You can use 

Query syntax, which resembles SQL, 
or 
Method syntax, which involves method chaining. 

Both syntaxes are equivalent, and you can choose the one that suits your preference.

LINQ simplifies data manipulation and is a significant improvement for developers, making code 
more readable and maintainable while reducing the need to write complex loops and conditions. 

It's a powerful tool in C# for working with various data sources.

The foreach loop executes the query on the data source and get the result and then iterates over 
the result set.


Query Syntax:
--------------
var result = from item in source
             where condition
             select item;

Method Syntax:
---------------
var result = source.Where(item => condition).Select(item => item);

The Scanner class in Java is a part of the java.util package.

It is used for reading input from various sources, such as the keyboard or files. 

It provides methods for parsing and processing different types of data, including text and primitive data types like 
integers, floats, and strings.

java.util.Scanner
-----------------------
We import the java.util.Scanner class.

Scanner object
----------------
We create a Scanner object that reads input from the standard input (keyboard) using System.in.

We prompt the user to enter their name.

scanner.nextLine()
--------------------
We use scanner.nextLine() to read a line of text entered by the user.

We display a greeting using the input.

scanner.close()
-------------------
Finally, we close the Scanner using scanner.close() to release the associated resources.

The Scanner class provides various methods to read different types of data, including nextInt(), nextDouble(), 
nextBoolean(), etc., which allow you to read specific data types from the input. 

It's a versatile tool for handling user input in Java applications.


next()
--------------
It will wait until we give valid input.

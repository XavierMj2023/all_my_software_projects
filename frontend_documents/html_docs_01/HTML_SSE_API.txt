*   Server-Sent Events (SSE) allow a web page to get updates from a server.

*   Server-Sent Events - One Way Messaging
    --------------------------------------
    A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets updates from a server.

    This was also possible before, but the web page would have to ask if any updates were 
    available. 
    
    With server-sent events, the updates come automatically.

*   Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds, sport results,...

*   EventSource object --> It is used to receive server-sent event notifications.

*   Check Server-Sent Events Support
    ---------------------------------------
    if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {
        // Yes! Server-sent events support!
        // Some code.....
    } else {
        // Sorry! No server-sent events support..
    }

*   For the example above to work, you need a server capable of sending data updates (like PHP 
    or ASP).

*   The server-side event stream syntax is simple. 

*   Set the "Content-Type" header to "text/event-stream". Now you can start sending event 
    streams.

*   Events	                                    Description
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    onopen	                                    When a connection to the server is opened
    onmessage	                                When a message is received
    onerror	                                    When an error occurs

*   STEPS
    ------------
    -> Set the "Content-Type" header to "text/event-stream"
    -> Specify that the page should not cache
    -> Output the data to send (Always start with "data: ")
    -> Flush the output data back to the web page

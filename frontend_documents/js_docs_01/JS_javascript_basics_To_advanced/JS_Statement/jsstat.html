                        dollar sign ($)

                        such as non-Latin characters or mathematical symbols. 
                        However, it's generally recommended to stick to ASCII characters for 
                        compatibility and readability.

                        If you need to represent multiple words, you can use camelCase or 
                        snake_case convention.

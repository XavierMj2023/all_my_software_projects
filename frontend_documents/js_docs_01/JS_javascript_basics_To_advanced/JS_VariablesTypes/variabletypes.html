                        The let keyword in JavaScript is used to declare block-scoped
                        variables, potentially limiting the scope of a variable to the block,
                        statement, or expression in which it is used.

                        ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
                        These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript.

                        Variables defined with let or const are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized

                    <li>Variables declared with <b>var</b> have Global Scope.</li>

                    <li>
                        Variables declared with var are either function-scoped or globally
                        scoped if declared outside any function.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If var is used inside a function, the variable is function-scoped.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If var is used outside of any function, it declares a global variable
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Variables declared with var are hoisted, which means they are moved to the top of
                        their enclosing scope (function or global) before code execution.
                        However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.
                        Accessing the variable before the declaration results in undefined.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        Within its scope, a variable declared with var can be re-declared without
                        causing an error, which can lead to potential bugs if not carefully
                        managed.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        Redeclaring a JavaScript variable with var is allowed anywhere in a
                        program.
                    </li>

            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization. If you try to use a variable
                        before it is declared and initialized, its value will be undefined.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        Eg:
                        <p>carModel = "Vivo La Rasa";</p>
                        <p>var carModel;</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td>
                Even though the assignment appears before the declaration in the code, the variable
                carName is already declared (due to hoisting) by the time the assignment happens.
                Therefore, the code works without throwing a ReferenceErro
                and carName ends up being "Vivo La Rasa".

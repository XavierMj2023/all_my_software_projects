*	There is only one equality operator: SequenceEqual. 

*	The SequenceEqual method checks whether the 

    1.number of elements
    
    2.value of each element 
    
    3.order of elements in two collections are equal or not.

*   If the collection contains elements of primitive data types then it compares the values and 
    number of elements, 
    
*   Whereas collection with complex type elements, checks the references of the objects. 

*   So, if the objects have the same reference then they considered as equal otherwise they are 
    considered not equal.

*   If the order of elements are not the same then SequenceEqual() method returns false.

*   The SequenceEqual method compares the number of items and their values for primitive data types.

*   The SequenceEqual method compares the reference of objects for complex data types.

*   Use IEqualityComparer class to compare two colection of complex type using SequenceEqual method.

# Python Indentation

# The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four,
# but it has to be at least one.
a = 5
b = 6
if a < b:
 print("6 is greather than 5")
else:
 print("5 is greather than 6")

# You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you
# an error.
# IndentationError: unexpected indent
# c = 5
# d = 6
# if c < d:
#  print("6 is greather than 5")
#   print("5 is greather than 6")

When it come to the Java File Handling, it handles as a Stream.

It can be output/input/error stream.

In java, stream are automatically created for us. All streams are attached with console.

System.out -> Output stream

System.in -> Input stream

System.err -> Error stream

If we do not give complete path, it will use the existing path which is nothing but your 
current project.

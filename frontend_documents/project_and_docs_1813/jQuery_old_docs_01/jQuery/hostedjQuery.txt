One big advantage of using the hosted jQuery from Google:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many users -->  downloaded jQuery --> from --> Google --> when visiting another site. 

As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site,--> leads --> faster loading time.

Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served

from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.

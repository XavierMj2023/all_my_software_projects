*   HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

*   The source file (src)
    Alternative text (alt)
    Width
    Height

*   Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.

*   The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

*   Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. 
    
*   The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.The <img> tag is empty, it contains 
    attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

*   The <img> tag has two required attributes:
    src     -   Specifies the path to the image
    alt     -   Specifies an alternate text for the image

*   Syntax: <img src="url" alt="alternatetext">

*   Example
    <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

*   If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute.
    To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src 
    attribute.

*   HTML allows animated GIFs.

*   Common Image Formats
    Here are the most common image file types, which are supported in all browsers (Chrome, Edge, 
    Firefox, Safari, Opera):

                                                                                        .pjp

        PNG	                                    Portable Network Graphics	            .png

*   <picture> element
    -------------------
    The HTML <picture> element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or 
    screen sizes.
    The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.
    The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images 
    through the srcset attribute. 
    This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.
    Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.
    Always specify an <img> element as the last child element of the <picture> element. 
    The <img> element is used by browsers that do not support the <picture> element, or if none of the 
    <source> tags match.
    Eg:
    -----
    <picture>
        <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
        <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
        <img src="img_girl.jpg">
    </picture>

*  When to use the Picture Element?
   -------------------------------
    There are two main purposes for the <picture> element:

    1. Bandwidth
    If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. 
    The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of 
    the following elements.

    2. Format Support
    Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. 
    By using the <picture> element, you can add images of all formats, and the browser will use the 
    first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following elements.

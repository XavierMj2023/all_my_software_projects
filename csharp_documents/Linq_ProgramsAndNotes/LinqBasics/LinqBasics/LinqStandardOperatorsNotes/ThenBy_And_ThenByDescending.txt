*	The ThenBy and ThenByDescending extension methods are used for sorting on multiple fields.

*	The OrderBy() method sorts the collection in ascending order based on specified field. 

*	Use ThenBy() method after OrderBy to sort the collection on another field in ascending order. 

*	Linq will first sort the collection based on primary field which is specified by OrderBy 
	method and then sort the resulted collection in ascending order again based on secondary field
	specified by ThenBy method.

*	The same way, use ThenByDescending method to apply secondary sorting in descending order.

*	OrderBy and ThenBy sorts collections in ascending order by default.

	ThenBy or ThenByDescending is used for second level sorting in method syntax.

	ThenByDescending method sorts the collection in decending order on another field.

	ThenBy or ThenByDescending is NOT applicable in Query syntax.

	Apply secondary sorting in query syntax by separating fields using comma.

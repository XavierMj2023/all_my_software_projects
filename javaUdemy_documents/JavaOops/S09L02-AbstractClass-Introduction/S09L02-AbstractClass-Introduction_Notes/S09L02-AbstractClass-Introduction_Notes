*	Interface provides complete abstraction.

*	Abstraction only show the declaration and implementation is done somewhere 
	else.
	
*	Implementation and Abstract Method as well.

*	Prefix class with keyword abstract is called Abstract Class.

*	In Abstract Class we can have implementation,properties ,Abstract Methods 
	and variables.

*	When to make use of Interfaces and Abstract Classes?

	Answer lies between relationship . 
	
	Relationship between inherited classes is Is-A Relationship.
	
	A Vegan is a Person.
	A Non Vegan is a Person
	
	Between Classes --> Is A Relationship --> Abstract Classes --> If there is a requirement.
	
	Relationship between interface and classe is Can Relationship.
	
	Between Class and Interface --> Can Relationship --> Interfaces --> If there is a requirement.
	
	
*	Multiple Inheritance is not supported in java.

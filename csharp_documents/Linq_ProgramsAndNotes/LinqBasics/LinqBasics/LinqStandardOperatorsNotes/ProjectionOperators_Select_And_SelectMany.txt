*	Projection Operators: Select, SelectMany
	------------------------------------------

*	There are two projection operators available in LINQ. 1) Select 2) SelectMany


*	Select
	---------
	The Select operator always returns an IEnumerable collection which contains elements based on a 
	transformation function. 
	It is similar to the Select clause of SQL that produces a flat result set.

*	Select in Query Syntax
	-----------------------
	LINQ query syntax must end with a Select or GroupBy clause.

*	The select operator can be used to formulat the result as per our requirement. 

*	It can be used to return a collection of custom class or anonymous type which includes properties as
	per our need.

*	Select in Method Syntax
	-------------------------
	The Select operator is optional in method syntax.However, you can use it to shape the data.
	
*	SelectMany
	--------------
	The SelectMany operator projects sequences of values that are based on a transform function and 
	then flattens them into one sequence.

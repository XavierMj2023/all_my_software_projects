*   HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA 
    values.

*   RGB
    ----------
    An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.
    Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 
    and 255.
    This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors.

*   RGBA
    ----------
    RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the 
    opacity for a color.
    An RGBA color value is specified with:rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
    The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all).

*   HEX
    ----------
    A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) 
    hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.

*   HSL
    ----------
    HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.
    Hue 
    ----------
    It is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

    Saturation 
    ----------
    It is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

    Lightness
    ----------
    It is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.

*   HSLA
    -----------
    HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values, with an Alpha channel - which specifies 
    the opacity for a color.
    The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all).

*   SYNTAX FOR EACH COLOR:
    --------------------------
    1.RGB       :   rga(red, green, blue, alpha)

    2.RGBA      :   rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)

    3.HEX       :   #rrggbb

    4.HSL       :   hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

    5.HSLA      :   hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)

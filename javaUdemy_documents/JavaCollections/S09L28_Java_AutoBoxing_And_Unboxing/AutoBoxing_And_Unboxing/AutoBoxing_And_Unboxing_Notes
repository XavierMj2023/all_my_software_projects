Integer in the code is the wrapper class.

ArrayList<Integer> numbersList = new ArrayList<>();


So in here in our last video we were making use of this integer wrapper class, 
the built in integer wrapper class.

And we also started with the int wrapper.

Now whenever we create a wrapper, wrapper is a very simple class where we have 
int pardon me, where we have a primitive data type.

And for handling the primitive data type we have firstly a constructor and we also
have the getter and setter.

So let's generate getters and setters as well.

All right.

So this is our wrapper.

And this is very simple.

But as soon as we make use of our manual user defined wrapper our user defined 
wrapper the ID will start complaining and it will no longer accept the values 
automatically.

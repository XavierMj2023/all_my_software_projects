In JS, Asynchronous refers to ability to perform tasks independently from the main program 
flow.

It allows code to intiate operations and continue running other tasks without waiting for 
them to finish.

It includes
-> Fetching Data from servers
-> Reading/Writing lines
-> Making API Calls

To handle asynchronous operations, JS provides mechanisms like
-> Callbacks :  Function executed after an asynchronous operation completes.

-> Promises  :  Represent future values and allow chaining multiple asynchronous operations.

-> Async/Await : Provide a more consise and synchronous-like way to write asynchronous code.

It improves
-> Program Responsivness
-> Prevent Blocking

It is mainly used with the Promises.

When a long running task needs to be performed without blocking the main thread of 
executation.
-> Network requests.
-> Accesing a Database
That time Async/Await is used.

    The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. 
    The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
    Ex:
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

*   src
    -------------------
    The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.
    Ex:
    <img src="img_girl.jpg">

*   width  and height
    --------------------
    Specify the width and height of the image (in pixels).

*   alt
    -------------------
    Specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.
    This can be due to

*   style

*   lang
    --------------------
    You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language 
    of the Web page. 
    This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
    Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. 
    So, 
    The first two characters --> define the language of the HTML page.
    The last  two characters --> define the country.

    Eg:
    <html lang="en-US">

*   title
    --------------------
    It defines some extra information about an element.
    The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the 
    element.

    Eg:
    <p title="Tooltip">This</p>

*   target
    --------------------
    By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. 
    To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
    It specifies where to open the linked document.
    It can have one of the following values:

    _self       -       Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
    _blank      -       Opens the document in a new window or tab
    _parent     -       Opens the document in the parent frame
    _top        -       Opens the document in the full body of the window

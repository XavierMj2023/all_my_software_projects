*	The GroupJoin operator performs the same task as Join operator except that GroupJoin returns a 
	result in group based on specified group key. 
	
*	The GroupJoin operator joins two sequences based on key and groups the result by matching key 
	and then returns the collection of grouped result and key.

*	GroupJoin requires same parameters as Join. 

*	GroupJoin has two overload methods.

*	As you can see in the first overload method takes five input parameters (except the first 'this' 
	parameter): 
	1) outer 
	2) inner 
	3) outerKeySelector 
	4) innerKeySelector 
	5) resultSelector. 
	
*	Please notice that resultSelector is of Func delegate type that has second input parameter as 
	IEnumerable type for inner sequence.


*	GroupJoin in Query Syntax
	------------------------------------
	GroupJoin operator in query syntax works slightly different than method syntax. 
	
	It requires an outer sequence, inner sequence, key selector and result selector. 
	
	'on' keyword is used for key selector where the left side of 'equals' operator is the 
	 outerKeySelector and the right side of 'equals' is the innerKeySelector. 
	 
	 Use the into keyword to create the grouped collection.

	Syntax:
	-------------
	from ... in outerSequence

	join ... in innerSequence  

	on outerKey equals innerKey

	into groupedCollection    

	select ...

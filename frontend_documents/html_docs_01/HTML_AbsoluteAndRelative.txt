*   ABSOLUTE URL    
    --------------------
    Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. 
    
    Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg"

*   RELATIVE URL
    --------------------
    Links to an image that is hosted within the website. 
    Here, the URL does not include the domain name. 
    If the 
    URL begins without a slash ---->    It will be relative to the current page.
    URL begins with a slash    ---->    It will be relative to the domain.

    It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

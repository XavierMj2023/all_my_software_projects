Write a TemperatureConversion program, given the temperature in Fahrenheit as
input outputs the temperature in Celsius or vice versa using the formula
Celsius to Fahrenheit: (°C × 9/5) + 32 = °F
Fahrenheit to Celsius: (°F − 32) x 5/9 = °C


In C#, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase is an enumeration value that can be used as a parameter to 
string comparison methods to perform case-insensitive comparisons. 

This means that when you use StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase, the comparison will be done without 
regard to the case of the characters in the strings.

Here's how you can use it in C#:

string str1 = "Hello";
string str2 = "hello";

bool areEqual = string.Equals(str1, str2, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);

if (areEqual)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The two strings are equal (case-insensitive).");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("The two strings are not equal (case-insensitive).");
}


In this example, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase is used in the string.

Equals method to compare str1 and str2 case-insensitively. 

As a result, it considers "Hello" and "hello" to be equal.

# Python is an object oriented programming language.
# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
# To create a class, use the keyword class.
class MyClass:
    x = 20

#Create a new object of MyClass
newobjForMyClass = MyClass()
print(newobjForMyClass)
print(newobjForMyClass.x)

*   Never Skip the End Tag
    -----------------------
    Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag.
    However, never rely on this.
    Unexpected results and errors may occur if you forget the end tag.

*   HTML is Not Case Sensitive.
    --------------------------
    HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
    The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but 
    ~ W3C recommends lowercase in HTML,  
    ~ Demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

*   Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code

*   A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element

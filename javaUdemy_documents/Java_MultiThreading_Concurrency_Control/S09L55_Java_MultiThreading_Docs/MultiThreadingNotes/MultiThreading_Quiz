In …………….state, a thread is ready to run. -> Runnable

In ………………. state, a thread is running.    -> Running

In Multi-threading, Synchronized elements can't be ran by multiple threads simultaneously. -> True

A synchronized block can be used to perform synchronization on a specific block. -> True

In Java, the value of the volatile variable can be cached. -> False

In Java, Which method wakes up all the waiting threads on the same object. -> notifyAll()

An interrupt is an indication to a thread that it should stop current operation and do something else. -> True

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The join() method is used to hold the execution of the currently running thread until the specified thread is finished execution. -> true

This is the correct option. 

In Java, the join() method is used to hold the execution of the currently running thread until the specified thread has finished 
executing. 

When a thread calls join() on another thread, it waits for that thread to complete before resuming its own execution. 

This allows for synchronization between threads and ensures that certain operations are completed in a specific order.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ThreadPoolExecutor class allows to set the maximum pool size. -> True

The ……...... method creates a fixed size thread pool based on the value passed. -> newFixedThreadPool(int)

CountDownLatch enables one or more threads to wait until a set of operations is completed by a thread. -> true

Threads are waiting for each other to release the resources for an indefinite time; the condition is called.............. -> Deadlock

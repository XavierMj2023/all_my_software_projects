STEPS TO CREATE IMAGE MAP
-------------------------
1:  Image Map
    An image map is an image with clickable areas.

2:  <map>
    Defines Image Map.

3:  <area>
    The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.

4:  The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on 
    where in the image you click.

5:  To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas.

6:  The image is inserted using the <img> tag. 
    The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute:

    <img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">


7:  The usemap value 
    -------------------
    It starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a 
    relationship between the image and the image map.

8:  The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required
    name attribute.The name attribute must have the same value as the <img>'s usemap attribute .

    <map name="workmap">

9:  A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.
    Shape
    ------------
    You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:

    rect        -       defines a rectangular region
    circle      -       defines a circular region
    poly        -       defines a polygonal region
    default     -       defines the entire region

    You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the 
    image. 

 10: A clickable area can also trigger a JavaScript function.
     Add a click event to the <area> element to execute a JavaScript function.

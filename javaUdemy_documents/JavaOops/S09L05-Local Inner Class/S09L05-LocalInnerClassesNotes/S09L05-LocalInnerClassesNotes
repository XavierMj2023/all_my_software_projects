Inner Classes are classes within another class.

Eg : Real Life -> Car (Class) -> Consist Of Engine(Class) -> Components

Useful : Non Static Inner Classes.

There are many types of classes:-

Member Inner Class -> Non Static Class inside a Non Static Class

Local Inner Class -> It is a class which is inside a scope of a block.Block can be a method as well.Scope 
					 limited to the code block only.
					 
Anonymous Inner Class -> Nameless Class inside a class.As no name to the inner class,we can only use once in
						 lifetime.
						 
Non Static Nested Class -> Known as Inner Class branch --> Instance of Non Static Inner Class contain
														   Instance of Inner Class
														   (Instance inside instance)
														   
Static Nested Class -> No Static Class need to accessed using object or an instance->Directly Access


Nested Classes -> Why? -> To Depict the real life scenario better.

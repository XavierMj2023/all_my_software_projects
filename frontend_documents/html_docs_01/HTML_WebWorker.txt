    the page.

    finished.

*   A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, 
    without affecting the performance of the page.
    
*   You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., 
    while the web worker runs in the background.

*   Check Web Worker Support
    ---------------------------
    if (typeof(Worker) !== "undefined") {
        // Yes! Web worker support!
        // Some code.....
        } else {
        // Sorry! No Web Worker support..
        }

*   postMessage()   -   Used to post a message back to the HTML page.

*   onmessage       -   Occurs when a message is received through an event source.

                        Syntax:
                        object.onmessage = function(){myScript};

*   Chrome doesn't let you load web workers when running scripts from a local file.

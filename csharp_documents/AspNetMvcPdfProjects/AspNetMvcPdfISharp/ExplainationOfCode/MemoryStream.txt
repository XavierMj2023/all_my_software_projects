MemoryStream in C# is a class that represents a stream that works with an in-memory byte array. 

It allows you to read from or write to memory as if it were a stream (similar to working with files or network 
streams).

Here's a breakdown of how MemoryStream is used in the provided code:

Instantiation and Usage:
--------------------------------------------
MemoryStream workStream = new MemoryStream();
--------------------------------------------
This line creates an instance of MemoryStream named workStream.
MemoryStream doesn’t interact with the hard disk; instead, it works entirely within the application's memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------
MemoryStream and Data Storage:
--------------------------------------------

MemoryStream operates entirely in the application's memory space

It stores its data in an array of bytes (byte array) that resides in the computer's RAM (random-access memory), 
not on the hard disk or any external storage.

Any operations performed on a MemoryStream—like writing data, reading data, or manipulating its content—occur within 
the application's memory space.

--------------------------------------------
Difference from File Streams:
--------------------------------------------
In contrast, when working with traditional file streams (like FileStream), the data is read from or written to a file 
located on the hard disk or external storage.

File streams interact with the physical storage device by performing disk I/O operations to read from or write to files.
Advantages of MemoryStream:

MemoryStream offers high-speed access to its data because it operates in memory, which is faster compared to accessing data from a disk.
It's useful for scenarios where you want to work with data purely in memory without the overhead of disk I/O operations.
In the context of the provided code snippet generating a PDF, the MemoryStream named workStream is used to hold the generated PDF content in memory before it's returned as a downloadable file (FileResult). This allows the PDF to be generated, manipulated, and served without physically writing it to the hard disk—instead, it's kept entirely in memory during the process.

C# - ValueTuple
---------------------------------
C# 7.0 (.NET Framework 4.7) introduced the ValueTuple structure, which is a value type representation of the Tuple.

The ValueTuple is only available in .NET Framework 4.7. 

If you don't see ValueTuple in your project, then you need to install the ValueTuple. (.NET Framework 4.7 or higher, 
or .NET Standard Library 2.0 or higher already includes ValueTuple.)

To install the ValueTuple package,

->	Right-click on the project in the solution explorer 

->	Select Manage NuGet Packages... This will open the NuGet Package Manager. 

->	Click the Browse tab

->	Search for ValueTuple in the search box

->	Select the System.ValueTuple package

---------------------------------
ValueTuple Initialization
---------------------------------
It is easy to create and initialize the ValueTuple. 

It can be created and initialized using parentheses () and specifying the values in it.

The ValueTuple can also be initialized by specifying the type of each element.

-----------------------------------------------
Note that we have not used var in the above tuple initialization statement; instead, we provided the type of each 
member values inside the brackets.

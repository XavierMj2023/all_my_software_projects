BASICS OF LINQ
---------------

Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).

It is a powerful set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into 
the C# language.

It provides a consistent query experience to query objects (LINQ to Objects), relational databases 
(LINQ to SQL), and XML (LINQ to XML).

It is Uniform query syntax in C# and VB.NET to retrieve data from different sources and formats.

It is integrated in C# or VB, thereby eliminating the mismatch between programming languages and 
databases, as well as providing a single querying interface for different types of data sources.

For example, SQL --> Structured Query Language --> used to --> save and retrieve data from a 
database. 

In the same way, LINQ is a structured query syntax built in C# and VB.NET to retrieve data from 
different types of data sources such as collections, ADO.Net DataSet, XML Docs, web service and 
MS SQL Server and other databases.

LINQ queries return results as objects. 

It enables you to uses object-oriented approach on the result set and not to worry about 
transforming different formats of results into objects.

It allows you to query and manipulate data in a more expressive and readable way. 

It provides a uniform way to query different data sources, such as collections, databases, XML, 
and more. 

LINQ makes it easier to work with data by allowing you to write queries in a language that closely 
resembles SQL (Structured Query Language).

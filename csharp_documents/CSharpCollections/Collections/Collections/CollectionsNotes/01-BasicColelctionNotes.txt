*	C# includes specialized classes that store series of values or objects are called collections.

*	There are two types of collections available in C#: 

	1.	Non-generic collections 
	2.	Generic collections.

*	System.Collections --> namespace contains the non-generic collection types

*	System.Collections.Generic -->  namespace includes generic collection types.

*	In most cases, it is recommended to use the generic collections because 

	:-They perform faster than non-generic collections 
	:-They also minimize exceptions by giving compile-time errors.

*   The div tag is known as Division tag. 

*   The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content in the web page like (text, images, 
    header, footer, navigation bar, etc). 
    
*   Div tag has both open (<div>) and closing (</div>) tag and it is mandatory to close the tag.

    the web page and we can create a particular section for particular data or function in the 
    web pages.

    applied to them.

    tag will start from a new line, and not the same line.

    CSS for them. 
    
*   Div tag can be used for creating a layout of web pages.

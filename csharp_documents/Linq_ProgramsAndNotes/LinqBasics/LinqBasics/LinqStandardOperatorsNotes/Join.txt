*   The joining operators joins the two sequences (collections) and produce a result.

*   Joining Operators	                Usage
    -------------------------------------------
    Join	                            The Join operator joins two sequences (collections) based 
                                        on a key and returns a resulted sequence.


    GroupJoin	                        The GroupJoin operator joins two sequences based on keys 
                                        and returns groups of sequences. 
                                        
                                        It is like Left Outer Join of SQL.

*   Join
    ------
    The Join operator operates on two collections, inner collection & outer collection. 
    It returns a new collection that contains elements from both the collections which satisfies 
    specified expression. 
    It is the same as inner join of SQL.

*   Join in Method Syntax
    ----------------------
    As you can see in the first overload method takes five input parameters (except the first 
    'this' parameter): 
    1) outer 
    2) inner 
    3) outerKeySelector 
    4) innerKeySelector 
    5) resultSelector.

*   Join in Query Syntax
    --------------------------
    Join operator in query syntax works slightly different than method syntax. 
    
    It requires outer sequence, inner sequence, key selector and result selector. 
    
    'on' keyword is used for key selector where left side of 'equals' operator is outerKeySelector 
     and right side of 'equals' is innerKeySelector.

    Syntax:
    -------
    from ... in outerSequence

            join ... in innerSequence  

            on outerKey equals innerKey

            select ...

*   Use the equals operator to match key selector in query syntax. == is not valid.
 
*   Points to Remember :

    Join and GroupJoin are joining operators.

    Join is like inner join of SQL. 
    It returns a new collection that contains common elements from two collections whose keys 
    matches.

    Join operates on two sequences inner sequence and outer sequence and produces a result sequence.

    Join query syntax:
    -------------------
    from... in outerSequence
    join... in innerSequence 
    on  outerKey equals innerKey
    select ...


    == is not valid.

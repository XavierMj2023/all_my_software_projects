*   In HTML, any element can be dragged and dropped.

*   Drag and drop is a very common feature. 

*   It is when you "grab" an object and drag it to a different location.

*   First of all: To make an element draggable, set the draggable attribute to true.Then, specify
    what should happen when the element is dragged.

*   dataTransfer.setData() method --> sets the data type and the value of the dragged data.

*   ondragstart attribute calls a function, drag(event), that specifies what data to be 
    dragged.

*   ondragover event specifies where the dragged data can be dropped.

*   By default, data/elements cannot be dropped in other elements. To allow a drop, we must 
    prevent the default handling of the element.

*   This is done by calling the event.preventDefault() method for the ondragover event.
    
    ->  event.preventDefault()
        ----------------------
        To prevent the browser default handling of the data (default is open as link on drop)

*   When the dragged data is dropped, a drop event occurs.

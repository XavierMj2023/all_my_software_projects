*   A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.

*   You can use any image you like as your favicon. 

*   You can also create your own favicon on sites like https://www.favicon.cc.

*   A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab.

*   To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your 
    webserver
    or 
    create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. 
    
*   A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".

*   Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element, like this

*   eg:
    ---
    <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>My Page Title</title>
                 <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>This is a Favicon</h1>
            </body>
        </html>

*   Now, save the "index.html" file and reload it in your browser.

*   Your browser tab should now display your favicon image to the left of the page title.

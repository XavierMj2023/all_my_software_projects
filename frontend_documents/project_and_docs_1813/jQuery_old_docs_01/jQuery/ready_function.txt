ready()
---------
It sets up an event listner for when the DOM structure of the page is fully parsed by the browser and is 
ready to be operated on. 



ready() and onload event()
----------------------------
Both are different.

Onload()  --> It fires only after all of the page content,including images,have been loaded.
              Depending on how many images you have ---> can take a while.

ready()   --> It much earlier than Onload event.



CODE EXPLAINATION:
--------------------------
So pass CallBack Function to the ready() and this callback function is the event handler that will be
fired when ready event is triggererd.

So the code once again calls the jQuery Function which is $.But this time it passes keyword "content" as
argument.

Indicating jQuery that we want to perform operation on the element in the page that has id of "content".

append()-->appends piece of content to the tag that we passed to the jQuery function.In this case
          <div>

Eg:
------------
$(document).ready(function () {
            $("button").click(function () {
                $("p").hide();
            });
        });

*   The HTML Geolocation API is used to locate a user's position.

*   The HTML Geolocation API is used to get the geographical position of a user.

*   Since this can compromise privacy, the position is not available unless the user approves 
    it.

*   Geolocation is most accurate for devices with GPS, like smartphones.

*   getCurrentPosition()
    ---------------------
    It is used to return the user's position.
    It returns an object on success. 
    The latitude, longitude and accuracy properties are always returned. 
    The other properties are returned if available.
    The second parameter of the getCurrentPosition() method is used to handle errors. 
    It specifies a function to run if it fails to get the user's location.

*   Geolocation is also very useful for location-specific information, like:
    1.  Up-to-date local information
    2.  Showing Points-of-interest near the user
    3.  Turn-by-turn navigation (GPS)

*   Properties:-

    coords.latitude	            The latitude as a decimal number (always returned)

    coords.longitude	        The longitude as a decimal number (always returned)

    coords.accuracy	            The accuracy of position (always returned)

    coords.altitude	            The altitude in meters above the mean sea level (returned if 
                                available)

    coords.altitudeAccuracy	    The altitude accuracy of position (returned if available)

    coords.heading	            The heading as degrees clockwise from North (returned if 
                                available)

    coords.speed	            The speed in meters per second (returned if available)

    timestamp	                The date/time of the response (returned if available)

*   The Geolocation object also has other interesting methods:
    watchPosition()     -   Returns the current position of the user and continues to return 
                            updated position as the user moves (like the GPS in a car).

    clearWatch()        -   Stops the watchPosition() method.

Grouping Operators: GroupBy & ToLookup
---------------------------------------

*	The grouping operators do the same thing as the GroupBy clause of SQL query. 

*	The grouping operators create a group of elements based on the given key. 

*	This group is contained in a special type of collection that implements an 
	IGrouping<TKey,TSource> interface where 

	TKey is a key value, on which the group has been formed 
	TSource is the collection of elements that matches with the grouping key value.

*	Grouping Operators						Description
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	GroupBy									The GroupBy operator returns groups of elements based 
											on some key value. 
											Each group is represented by IGrouping<TKey, TElement> 
											object.

	ToLookup								ToLookup is the same as GroupBy.

											The only difference is the execution of GroupBy is 
											deferred whereas ToLookup execution is immediate.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

*	GroupBy
	--------
	The GroupBy operator returns a group of elements from the given collection based on some key 
	value. 

	Each group is represented by IGrouping<TKey, TElement> object. 

	Also, the GroupBy method has eight overload methods, so you can use appropriate extension 
	method based on your requirement in method syntax.

	Note:
	A LINQ query can end with a GroupBy or Select clause.

	The result of GroupBy operators is a collection of groups. 
	
	For example, GroupBy returns IEnumerable<IGrouping<TKey,Student>> from the Student collection.

*	GroupBy in Method Syntax
	----------------------------
	The GroupBy() extension method works the same way in the method syntax. 
	Specify the lambda expression for key selector field name in GroupBy extension method.

*	ToLookup
	--------------
	ToLookup is the same as GroupBy; the only difference is GroupBy execution is deferred, 
	whereas ToLookup execution is immediate. 
	
	Also, ToLookup is only applicable in Method syntax and not supported in the query syntax.

*	GroupBy & ToLookup return a collection that has a key and an inner collection based on a key 
	field value.

	The execution of GroupBy is deferred whereas that of ToLookup is immediate.

	A LINQ query syntax can be end with the GroupBy or Select clause.

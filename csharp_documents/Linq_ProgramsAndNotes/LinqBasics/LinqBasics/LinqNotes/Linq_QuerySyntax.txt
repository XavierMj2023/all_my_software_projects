Query syntax in LINQ uses a SQL-like syntax to express queries for filtering, projecting, and 
sorting data. 

It provides a more intuitive and readable way to work with data. 

Bsic Syntax 
------------
var queryResult = from item in source
                  where condition
                  select item;

from:   This clause specifies the range variable (item in this case) and the data source (source) 
        that you want to query. 
      
        The range variable represents individual elements from the data source.

where:  This clause is used for filtering. You specify a condition that each element in the 
        data source must meet to be included in the result. 
      
        Elements that don't satisfy the condition are filtered out.

select: This clause is used for projecting. It defines what data or transformation of data you 
        want to include in the result. 
        It selects the properties or expressions you want to extract from each element.

S09L09-Static Inner Class
----------------------------

So A True inner class is a class where everything is a static and then only we would be able to access the testing 
inner class method.

A true static class is a class where all the elements inside the class are static, may it be methods, 
may it be variable, and that will give us the ease to access the elements inside the static class using the static 
way.

We need not to create a object to access the elements.

Properties and Variables are same.

If we would like to access Outer Elements , then those needs to be static.Then Only we can achieve true inner static 
class.

If we would like to take advantage of a true static inner class, it is always good that only access the variables
and the methods which are of a static type.

If we have an inner class, inner class has the access to the private entities as well.

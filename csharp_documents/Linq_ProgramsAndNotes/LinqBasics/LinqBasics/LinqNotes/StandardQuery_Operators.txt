*	Standard Query Operators in LINQ are actually Extension methods for the IEnumerable<T> and 
	IQueryable<T> types. 

*	They are defined in the System.Linq.Enumerable and System.Linq.Queryable classes. 

*	There are over 50 standard query operators available in LINQ that provide different 
	functionalities like filtering, sorting, grouping, aggregation, concatenation, etc.

*	Standard query operators in query syntax is converted into extension methods at compile time. 
	So both are same.

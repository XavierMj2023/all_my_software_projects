*   Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
    There are two display values: 
    1.block
    2.inline

*   Block-level Elements
    --------------------------
    A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space 
    (a margin) before and after the element.

    A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and 
    right as far as it can).

    Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

    Block level elements take up as much space as possible by default. 
    
    Each block level element will start a new line on the page, stacking down the page. 
    
    In addition to stacking vertically, block level elements will also take up as much horizontal 
    space as possible.

    They consume the entire width available irrespective of their sufficiency.
    
    They always start in a new line and have top and bottom margins. 
    
    It does not contain any other elements next to it.

    Eg:
    p element
    -------------------------------------------
    Each new paragraph tag will appear on its own line vertically. 
    Paragraphs with longer content will stretch all the way to the edge of the page.

    Here are the block-level elements in HTML:
    --------------------------------------------
    <address>   <article>   <aside> <blockquote> <canvas>   <dd>    <div>   <dl>    <dt>    <fieldset>
    
    <figcaption>    <figure>    <footer>    <form>  <h1>-<h6>   <header>    <hr>    <li>    <main>
    
    <nav>   <noscript>  <ol>    <p> <pre>   <section>   <table> <tfoot> <ul>    <video>


*   Inline Elements
    ------------------------
    An inline element does not start on a new line.An inline element only takes up as much width as 
    necessary.

    An inline element cannot contain a block-level element.

    Inline elements display in a line. 
    
    They do not force the text after them to a new line.

    Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to
    it which are inline.
    
    Inline elements don’t start from a new line and don’t have top and bottom margins as block 
    elements have.

    Eg:
    An anchor (or link) is an example of an inline element. 
    You can put several links in a row, and they will display in a line.

    Here are the inline elements in HTML:
    --------------------------------------
    <a> <abbr>  <acronym>   <b> <bdo>   <big>   <br>    <button>    <cite>  <code>  <dfn>   <em>  <i>
    
    <img>   <input> <kbd>   <label> <map>   <object>    <output>    <q>     <samp>  <script>
    
    <select>    <small> <span>  <strong>    <sub>   <sup>   <textarea>  <time>
    
    <tt>    <var>

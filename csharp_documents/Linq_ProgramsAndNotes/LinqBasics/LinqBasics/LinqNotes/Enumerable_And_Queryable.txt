*	The Enumerable class includes extension methods for the classes that implement IEnumerable<T> 
	interface.

*	The Queryable class includes extension methods for classes that implement IQueryable<t> 
	interface. 

*	The IQueryable<T> interface is used to provide querying capabilities against a specific data 
	source where the type of the data is known. 
	
	Example: 
	---------
	Entity Framework api implements IQueryable<T> interface to support LINQ queries 
	with underlaying databases such as MS SQL Server.

	Also, there are APIs available to access third party data; 
	
	Example:
	---------
	LINQ to Amazon provides the ability to use LINQ with Amazon web services to search for books 
	and other items. 
	
	This can be achieved by implementing the IQueryable interface for Amazon.

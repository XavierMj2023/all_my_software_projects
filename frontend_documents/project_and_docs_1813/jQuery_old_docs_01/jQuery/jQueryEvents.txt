* jQuery is tailor-made to respond to events in an HTML page.

* What are Events?

  All the different visitors' actions that a web page can respond to are called events.

  An event represents the precise moment when something happens.

  Examples:
  1:	moving a mouse over an element
  2:	selecting a radio button
  3:	clicking on an element

  The term "fires/fired" is often used with events. 
  Example: "The keypress event is fired, the moment you press a key".

  Here are some common DOM events:

  Mouse Events		Keyboard Events			Form Events			Document/Window Events

	click				keypress				submit				load
	dblclick			keydown					change				resize
	mouseenter			keyup					focus				scroll
	mouseleave	 		blur					unload

  jQuery Syntax For Event Methods
	In jQuery, most DOM events have an equivalent jQuery method.

	To assign a click event to all paragraphs on a page, you can do this:

	$("p").click();

	The next step is to define what should happen when the event fires. You must pass a function 
	to the event:

	$("p").click(function(){
	  // action goes here
	});

*	Aggregation Operators
	----------------------
*	The aggregation operators perform mathematical operations like Average, Aggregate, Count, Max, Min 
	and Sum, on the numeric property of the elements in the collection.

	Method								Description
	-------------------------------------------------
	Aggregate							Performs a custom aggregation operation on the values in the 
										collection.

	Average								calculates the average of the numeric items in the collection.

	Count								Counts the elements in a collection.

	LongCount							Counts the elements in a collection.

	Max									Finds the largest value in the collection.

	Min									Finds the smallest value in the collection.

	Sum									Calculates sum of the values in the collection.
	-------------------------------------------------

*	Aggregate
	----------

*	Aggregate operator is Not Supported with query syntax in C# or VB.Net.

*	As per the above figure, first item of strList "One" will be pass as s1 and rest of the items will 
	be passed as s2. 
	
*	The lambda expression (s1, s2) => s1 + ", " + s2 will be treated like s1 = s1 + ", " + s1 where s1 
	will be accumulated for each item in the collection. 
	
*	Thus, Aggregate method will return comma separated string.

*	Average
	----------

*	Average extension method calculates the average of the numeric items in the collection. 

*	Average method returns nullable or non-nullable decimal, double or float value.

*	You can specify an int, decimal, double or float property of a class as a lambda expression of which
	you want to get an average value.

*	Count
	----------

*	C# Query Syntax doesn't support aggregation operators. 

*	However, you can wrap the query into brackets and use an aggregation functions.
